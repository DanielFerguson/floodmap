FloodMap is a community-powered solution to help make navigating floods safer, together.

With the crazy flooding that is occuring in Australia, I wanted to create a simple, SPA that would help people points and sections of roads that they know are flooded.

This data could be used in a variety of ways; like to help...

- people plan their travel routes accordingly,
- government and councils to identify people cut off from necessary infrastructure, and
- much more...

## Features
